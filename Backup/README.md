These snapshots are for depicting the correct timing for the appearance of the warning pop-up message for starting the VCell Service.
For this testing I have **stopped my ImageJ service in VCell**

So in this one we could see the appearence of the popup which tells the user that the VCell service is not active

which is then followed by the warning pop-up message

Which does'nt holds importance as in the previous dialog box it is already made clear that the user needs to make the VCell Service Active

Whereas in this one, as the user gets started with ImageJ, and clicks on the desired plugin, he gets the warning message, which acts as a reminder that he should make the VCell Service active for proceeding further.
